   - Keep pairs where one feature is 'price' (these are good predictors)

3. Open `analysis_categorical_features_detailed.csv`
   - Decide encoding strategy based on unique value counts
   - <10 categories → One-hot encoding
   - \>10 categories → Label encoding or target encoding

2. Open `analysis_facilities_summary.csv` ⭐ NEW
   - If correlation is strong (>0.3), keep as important feature
   - Consider creating facility bins (0, 1-3, 4-6, 7-10, 10+)

3. Open `analysis_correlations_detailed.csv`
   - Create interaction features between high-correlation features
   - Example: Property_Size × Bedrooms
